[Aleksi Peltonen](https://peltona.github.io/) created a great lecture
[slide deck](https://github.com/peltona/tamarin-course) for a graduate-level course on Tamarin.

The slide deck is designed to be used together with the [Tamarin book](/book/index.html).

Use the slide deck to learn more about Tamarin, or use it to develop your own Tamarin course:
the CC-BY license means you can reuse and adapt the material for your own purposes, as long as you attribute correctly. 

The slide deck comes with the final PDF output but also includes the Latex source files used to produce them, so they can be easily adapted.
